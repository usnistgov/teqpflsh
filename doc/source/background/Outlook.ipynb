    "* [The GEOS library is available under the LGPL license](https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/main/COPYING). To get the python wheels to work properly with RPATH, I had to statically link GEOS. That means that ``teqpflsh`` falls under a LGPL license. I tried every thing I could think of to fix the RPATH issues inside the wheel, nothing worked. It is a high priority to resolve this to allow any library linking against ``teqpflsh`` to use whatever license terms it wants.\n",
    "* Look into the memory used by the K-D trees, see if it can be further optimized because some copies of data are being made and some of these copies can in theory at least be avoided\n",
    "* Resolve issues where the bounding polygon of a region is not simple (has self-intersection). This happens especially in the case of water at low temperatures. Such self-intersection does not happen in $T$, $\\rho$ coordinates, but does happen in other coordinate sets\n",
    "* Automate generation of the bounding polygons in C++. Currently the bounding polygon is generated in Python and passed into C++. To do so will require to implement the melting line models, and additional conversions might be required in [REFPROP-interop](https://github.com/ianhbell/REFPROP-interop)\n",
    "* See if there is a better way to define the bounding edges of the regions. Perhaps splines or something like that might be better, enabling a more efficient representation, not requiring as many points to remap into other coordinates more smoothly."
